# Neural-Networks-From-Zero-with-PyTorch

The overarching goal for creating this repo is for a first step in learning neural networks. In partiuclar, this is done via PyTorch on Python. All tutorials are based from various existing sources (which will always be credited), but are greatly expanded with background theory and helpful explanations.

There will be no partiuclar order in which these are created. Furthermore, the overall structure of this repo will change as it grows.
